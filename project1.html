                        <p>
                            At the University of Missouri - St. Louis (UMSL), the students majoring in Information Systems is required to take a capstone class called Systems Design. In this class, the students are required to find a real client with a real challenge. The students
                            are to take this challenge and propose the solution for the client to ideally use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within my group, we brainstormed ideas on whom could be our client. One member of my group, recommended the Green Park Lutheran School's Before Care and After Care Program. The Green Park Lutheran School was experiencing process pains with the Before
                            Care and After Care program for tracking when students were arriving and leaving.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please see Project Manager under Responsibilities for what I did.
                        </p>

                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                            <p>
                                Our client's challenge was using an old fashion system of using pen and paper for everything. By utilizing the pen and paper system it caused errors and difficulties. Errors that happened were from user-error by not recording times correctly. Due to this
                                error, the most difficult part was going back and manually changing on the paper before submitting the records for requesting payments. Storage was down by a bankers box and only storing the material for a certain amount
                                of time. Due to limited space it was difficult for them to even store a lot of their paperwork.
                            </p>

                            <h4>The Solution</h4>

                            <p>
                                My team of six proposed a solution with today's technology. We built out an entire system that will help eliminate paper usage and 90% non-human error. The system allows for the administrators to add, remove, and manage their database. Database includes
                                the families enrolled for the program and the items for each day (i.e. popsicles).
