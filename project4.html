                        <h4>Info</h4>

                        <p>
                            The University of Missouri – St Louis (UMSL) hosts an annual Women’s Hackathon. The event was founded by Professor Brian Lawton to ensure women are acknowledged in the Information Systems Department. Over the last 5 years, the event has been opened to
                            all students in the College of Business on different studies who have little or no experience to come and learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In one day, more like in seven hours, students and professionals gather to compete against each other. The focus is to build a game, web app, mobile app, or desktop app for a specific theme whether it is working or non-working to present at the end of
                            the day. Each person on the top three winning teams gets a prize at the end of the day that represented the best ideas. For an event like this, we need a strong team on the backend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Women’s Hackathon is solely organized and run by students with the assistance of faculty advisors. In order for the event to be successful, we need UMSL officials, participants, teams, judges, mentors/volunteers, and a planning committee. Many phases
                            are considered when gathering wants and needs that are necessary for the Women’s Hackathon.

                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                            <p>
                                In prior years, there was no website for the event to be able to promote the event on the internet. Therefore, within the last year I voluntarily started working on a website for the event. The biggest challenge was to create a sufficient site that has
                                a strong UI/UX for the end-users.
                            </p>

                            <h4>The Solution</h4>

                            <p>
                                To provide the event with an easy market on the internet, I have completed a front-end website. The full solution is to create full-stack website that can be managed by the organizer of the event. This is to propose a higher traffic rate on the internet
                                for promotion of the event to get more participants and mentors.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            To understand the problem that the website is supposed to solve, design a solution, develop the site and test before releasing to customers.

                        <p>
                            To design, test and maintain the entity of the website. Tailor the website specific to the event needs in order to be suitable for the users of the site.
