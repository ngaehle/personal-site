                        <h4>Info</h4>

                        <p>
                            At the University of Missouri - St Louis, one of the Information System and Technology has coding classes and one has a course number of IS 6805/3844. That course is called Developing Business Applications in .NET. The class has multiple assignments and
                            one of them is a group project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The group for the project has a choice as to what they want to build out of three choices. Calorie Calculating application, Fitness Tracking Application, and Employee & Production Worker Application were the three choices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this assignment is to create an application as a group virtually. Please see the Project Manager for my responsibilities.
                        </p>

                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                            <p>
                                One of the biggest challenges my team had right away was the communication amongst each other. The biggest challenge though was the collaboration on GitHub of the coded application as it kept providing issues throughout the process.
                            </p>

                        </div>

                            <h4>The Solution</h4>

                            <p>
                                We overcame the first issue be starting to communicate more as we had opened another communication method through Slack. The bigger of the two challenges was the GitHub account. In order to solve this, we decided to start putting everything into a zip
                                folder and sending that over Slack.
                            </p>
