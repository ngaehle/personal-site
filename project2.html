                        <h4>Info</h4>

                        <p>
                            At the University of Missouri - St. Louis (UMSL), the students majoring in Information Systems is required to take a pre-requiste class called Systems Analysis. In this class, the students are required to provide an analysis to a client with a real challenge.
                            The students are to take this challenge and propose the solution for the client to ideally use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The class is provided the client by the professor of the class. Each semester the professor changed whom the client is but lays out the same milestones. The Office of Transfer Services at UMSL was experiencing process pains with how the department site
                            was not beneficial to prospective students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My team worked together but we did have one person lead the project as a project manager. The group decided that I would be the project manager, an analyst, and prototype developer for functionality.
                        </p>

                    </div>

                        <div class='col-md-6'>

                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>

                            <p>
                                Our clients challenge was that they had two departments that needed to be combined into one site altogether. Those two departments are Transfer Services and Off-Campus Sites. The other difficult thing they had was that they are on a cascade management
                                system that is causing issues with modifying how the sites look like. Part of the challenge was also wanting a better idea on how to market UMSL to junior college students to attend UMSL as a transfer student.
                            </p>

                        </div>

                            <h4>The Solution</h4>

                            <p>
                                My team of four proposed a solution to leave the sites separate but to market differently. For the transfer services site, we proposed a prototype where an event calendar is on the site for the upcoming events. For the off-campus sites, we didnâ€™t propose
                                for any direct changes to the site. For both, we took the approach where the marketing should include local veterans of the police and army.

                            Prototype Developer: Creation of layout of the proposed site including functionality and design. The functionality is to ideally provide an outline of how the site should work. The design is to set the overall look of the site without functionality.
